# CORS Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem
The frontend deployed on Vercel was getting CORS errors when trying to access the Railway backend:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://repotrackr-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/projects/?limit=20&offset=0' 
from origin 'https://repotrackr-c1jjpqgz7-tannercline-5407s-projects.vercel.app' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause
The backend CORS configuration only allowed localhost origins for development, but didn't include the Vercel production domains.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated CORS Configuration
Modified `backend/app/core/config.py` to include Vercel domains:

```python
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS: List[str] = [
    "http://localhost:3000", 
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "https://repotrackr-c1jjpqgz7-tannercline-5407s-projects.vercel.app",
    "https://repotrackr.vercel.app"
]
```

### 2. Updated Environment Examples
- Updated `backend/.env.example` with Vercel domains
- Updated `backend/.env.railway.example` with Vercel domains

### 3. Deployed Changes
- Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
- Railway automatically deployed the updated configuration

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Origins
- `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- `https://repotrackr.vercel.app` (production)

### ❌ Still Not Working
- `https://repotrackr-c1jjpqgz7-tannercline-5407s-projects.vercel.app` (your specific Vercel domain)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Deployment
The deployment might still be in progress. Wait a few minutes and test again.

### Option 2: Set Environment Variable in Railway
If the deployment doesn't pick up the changes, set the CORS environment variable directly in Railway:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to your RepoTrackr project
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Add environment variable:
   ```
   BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000", "https://repotrackr-c1jjpqgz7-tannercline-5407s-projects.vercel.app", "https://repotrackr.vercel.app"]
   ```
5. Restart the service

### Option 3: Check Vercel Domain
Verify the exact domain name being used by your Vercel deployment. It might be slightly different from what we configured.

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify CORS configuration:
```bash
python test_cors.py
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. Open your Vercel frontend
2. Check the browser's developer console
3. The CORS errors should be resolved
4. The frontend should successfully fetch data from the backend

## Additional Notes

- The backend health endpoint is working: `https://repotrackr-production.up.railway.app/health`
- The API endpoints are responding correctly
- CORS middleware is properly configured
- Only the specific Vercel domain needs to be added to the allowed origins
