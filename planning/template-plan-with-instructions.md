<!--
This file is a scaffolded project plan that RepoTrackr can parse automatically.

What is RepoTrackr?
- A lightweight dashboard that reads a Markdown plan from your repo, extracts checkbox tasks,
  and shows progress (percent complete, counts, status) with minimal setup.

How to use this file:
1) Fill in the placeholders below (project name, dates, etc.).
2) Add tasks using these markers (RepoTrackr recognizes them):
   - [ ] Task not started (todo)
   - [~] Task in progress (doing)
   - [x] Task completed (done)
   - [!] Task blocked (blocked)
3) Commit and push. Then add this repository to RepoTrackr with the plan path (default: docs/plan.md).
4) Update tasks as you workâ€”RepoTrackr will reflect changes automatically.

Notes:
- You can place this file at docs/plan.md (recommended), plan.md, or keep a Plan section in README.md.
- Advanced: You may include a repotrackr.yml at repo root to declare the plan path(s) and customize markers.
